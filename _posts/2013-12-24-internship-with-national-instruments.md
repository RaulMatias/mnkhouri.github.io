In my last post, I noted that I was now a Certified LabVIEW associate developer, and that I was hoping to translate that certification into further opportunities to use LabVIEW. I am happy to say that I will be working as an Engineering Leadership Program Intern for National Instruments this coming summer! Working in Austin, TX should be a great time (outside of the heat, but I've worked in Texas summers before), and I think the internship program at NI is well structured to expose me to a wide variety of career paths.
