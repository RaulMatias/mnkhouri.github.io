Hi!

My name is Marc, and this is my place for thoughts, project updates, and other things I find interesting. If you want to get in touch, send me a message at <a href="mailto:{{ site.contact.email }}">{{ site.contact.email }}</a>.

I am currently working as an embedded software engineer at [Wink](http://www.wink.com), helping bring "smart" to the smart home. In all facets of our lives, we spend an increasingly large amount of time interacting with machines. Though is cheaper than ever to embed an electronic brain in the objects that surround us, many of us are frustrated by unintuitive and unreliable experiences with our smart devices. My passion lies in refining these interactions to make them efficient, consistent, and valuable.

Interests and skills: Embedded device development, digital design with FPGAs, analog circuit design (including at RF frequencies), test and test automation, microcontrollers (from AVR to ARM), international opportunities in French and German
